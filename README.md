Create a Photo Gallery application that has a single page where you show Images from the /photos endpoint at https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/. On this page, you should retrieve the photos and display the title and the thumbnail.
Once a user clicks on a photo or a title, you should show a Modal with the full photo and the title.
You must use Vue.js or React as a Javascript framework and Bootstrap.
The code should be easy to run and it should have the instructions needed to do it.
